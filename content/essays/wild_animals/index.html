<p>Wild animals are found in the forest. They are untamed. Some wild animals are herbivorous (plant-eating), others are carnivorous (flesh-eating). Giraffes, deers and zebras eat only grass or leaves. Tigers, lions and foxes eat only flesh of other animals.</p>

<p>Every wild animal has its own special feature for escaping from attack. The deer has thin legs that help it to run very fast. The zebra has black and white stripes which blend with the background. The rhinoceros has a fat, sharp horn in the centre of its head.</p>

<p>Human beings sometimes catch wild animals and tame them. Then they are kept in a zoo or in a circus to entertain us.</p>

<p>Some people kill the wild animals for their skin or other parts like tusks of elephants which they sell to make money. Some people hunt wild animals just for fun. The government has declared some forests wild life sancturies to protect and preserve wild animals. Hunting is prohibited in wild life sancturies.</p>
