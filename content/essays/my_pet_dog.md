## My Pet Dog

I have a pet named Moti. He is a small dog with soft fur and a very wet tongue. He is very playful. We often roll on the floor and have a lot of fun.

I have taught Moti a few tricks. He can shake hands. He can stand on his hind legs. He can bring in the newspaper. When I praise him he wags his tail joyfully.

Moti is a good watchdog. He growls and barks at any stranger who comes to the home. Moti is very loyal and loving. When I come home he jumps all around me, wagging his tail with happiness. Moti is my favourite playmate. I love Moti, and so do all my friends.
